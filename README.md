# hammeringkeys, a simple blog üßê

Having many ideas, wanting to organize my technical findings/adventures as a developer, and working on my communications prompted me to find an outlet. hammeringkeys is the place I envisioned sharing my pieces of writing.

This blog was created as a guiding project to explore and touch upon all the sides of setting up the architecture and infrastructure for a full-stack web app which I don't get to interact with on a daily basis. The objectives were:
- Setting up a react application and making my own package/plugin decisions, tsconfig, prettier rules, and testing environment
- Creating my first backend API and my first use of MongoDB to manage data storage
- Setting up a CI/CD pipeline with staging/dev environment
- Creating an open-source repo for use by any fellow devs
